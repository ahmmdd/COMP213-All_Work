                    In the first four Olympics, competitions were not held in pools, but
                    rather in open water (1896, the

                        1904 Olympics
                    </a>' races were the only ones ever measured at yards,
                    instead of the usual metres. A 100-metre pool was built for the
                    <a class="mw-redirect" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1908_Olympics" title="1908 Olympics">

                        1912 Olympics
                    </a>, held in the Stockholm harbour, marked the beginning

                    Male swimmers wore full body swimsuits up until the 1940s, which
                    caused more drag in the water than their modern swim-wear counterparts.
                    Also, over the years, pool designs have lessened the drag. Some design
                    considerations allow for the reduction of swimming

                        resistance
                    </a> making the pool faster. Namely, proper pool depth,
                    elimination of waves, elimination of currents, increased lane width,
                    energy absorbing racing lane lines and gutters, and the use of other
                    innovative hydraulic, acoustic, illumination, and swimwear designs.

                    </a> were the first to use the standard 50 metre pool with
                    marked lanes. In the freestyle, swimmers originally dove from the pool
                    walls, but diving blocks were incorporated starting at the

                        flip-turn

                        butterfly stroke
                    </a> events were not held until 1956. According to the
                    rules before then, the butterfly stroke was allowed in the

                        breaststroke
                    </a> races - but then the contest rules were changed,
                    abolishing the use of the butterfly stroke in the breaststroke races.

                    Women were first allowed the longer distance of 800 metres freestyle
                    in 1968, which remains the longest distance for women. Up until then,
                    women were considered to be too "delicate" to swim a race this long,
                    even though the men had had the 1,500 metre freestyle from the very
                    early years.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Both men and women were granted the 200 metre freestyle race in 1968,
                    giving swimmers an intermediate distance race between 100 metres and 400
                    metres.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Women's teams were first granted the 800 metre freestyle relay race
                    in 1996 - even though there had been a men's relay race at that distance
                    since 1912. At six Olympiads, the men had two freestyle relay races, but
                    the women only had one. Now, both sexes have two.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The medley relay races (4×100 metres) were not held for men or for
                    women until 1960, but they have continued in every Olympiad since then.
