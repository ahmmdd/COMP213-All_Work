                Environmental protection is a practice of protecting the natural environment on individual,
                organizational or governmental levels, for the benefit of both the natural environment and humans.
                Due to the pressures of population and technology, the biophysical environment is being degraded,
                sometimes permanently. This has been recognized,
                and governments have begun placing restraints on activities that cause environmental degradation.
                Since the 1960s, activity of environmental movements has created awareness of the various environmental issues.
                There is no agreement on the extent of the environmental impact of human activity,
                and protection measures are occasionally criticized.

                The environmental impact of fishing can be divided into issues that involve the
                availability of fish to be caught, such as overfishing, sustainable fisheries,
                and fisheries management; and issues that involve the impact of fishing on
                other elements of the environment, such as by-catch.<br><br>These conservation
                issues are part of marine conservation, and are addressed in fisheries science
                programs. There is a growing gap between how many fish are available to be
                caught and humanity’s desire to catch them, a problem that gets worse as the
                world population grows.<br><br>Similar to other environmental issues, there can
                be conflict between the fishermen who depend on fishing for their livelihoods
                and fishery scientists who realize that if future fish populations are to be
                sustainable then some fisheries must reduce or even close.<br><br>The journal
                Science published a four-year study in November 2006, which predicted that, at
                prevailing trends, the world would run out of wild-caught seafood in 2048. The
                scientists stated that the decline was a result of overfishing, pollution and
                other environmental factors that were reducing the population of fisheries at
                the same time as their ecosystems were being degraded. Yet again the analysis
                has met criticism as being fundamentally flawed, and many fishery management
                officials, industry representatives and scientists challenge the findings,
                although the debate continues. Many countries, such as Tonga, the United
                States, Australia and New Zealand, and international management bodies have
                taken steps to appropriately manage marine resources.
